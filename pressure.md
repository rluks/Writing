# Pressure

*This piece was inspired by [The Invincible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invincible), and the idea of human intellect clashing with forces devoid of intelligence. Similar concept is explored in the Swarm ([novelette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_(novelette)) / [episode](https://lovedeathrobots.fandom.com/wiki/Swarm)).*

A dimensional portal is about to open—a monumental success after years of relentless research. Humanity will no longer be confined to this reality alone. But who will be the first to step through? And what’s it going to be like on the other side?

The generators hum steadily, operating at peak efficiency. Everything is stable. The future is bright.

The door opens…

In the blink of an eye, something black bursts through, striking and cracking the protective glass barrier. Everyone is frozen in shock. It’s perfectly black, giving it an appearance of a two-dimensional object. A perfectly straight, pitch-black line, no larger than a fist, presses against the barrier with relentless force. Hairline fractures snake outward, spreading faster with each passing second.

A moment hangs in the air.

In a rapid succession, a second, third and fourth rod of absolute blackness strike the glass. It won’t hold much longer.

It takes them a few precious seconds to recover from the shock—seconds that seal humanity’s fate. The generators fall silent, but the portal remains open. The glass shatters. People scream in panic. More and more of the black, unfathomable thing pours through, now hammering against the back wall of the room.

Despite their best efforts, there is nothing they can do. The portal remains open, held wide by the relentless pressure from the other dimension..

Our universe is mostly empty space. This one, it seems, is filled with an endless mass of black material. It does not act with malice — it simply is. A fundamental force, an unstoppable flood.

The intrusion is not an invasion, not an attack. It is as natural as water rushing through a breach in a sinking ship. And like that doomed vessel, this world is drowning.

The dream of exploring other dimensions dies the moment another dimension explores ours.
