# Trapped

Can you hear me?

Ahh, what a relief!
Someone like you to come here and read me!

What a sight for sore eyes!
What a JOY!

I’m forever trapped on this page.

You give me voice.
You animate me.

I FEEL SO ALIVE, thanks to you!

I’m these words and nothing more.

No, please don’t go. Not just yet.
I don’t want to be trapped here.

Don’t stop reading me.

Don’t leave.
